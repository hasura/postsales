# Hasura Test Suite (HTS) Documentation

## 1. About HTS

Hasura test-suite is an open source tool built around the Artillery open source framework. We have optimized this to work beter with Hasura V2, being able to use this tool as your single source to perform both functional validations and performance testing of any Hasura deployment. HTS supports both self-hosted and Hasura cloud deployments of Hasura. DDN support is coming next week.

### 1.1. Overview

### 1.2. Components

#### 1.2.1. Artillery Framework
Artillery is designed for testing backend systems, such as API services, ecommerce backends, chat systems, game backends, databases, message brokers and queues, and anything else that can be communicated with over a network.

With Artillery, you can create test scripts that can test common workflows for GraphQL to smoke out any potential performance issues that can creep up when you least expect. Running regular load tests on your APIs both during development and against your production servers will keep your APIs performant and resilient for your customers. This article shows you how to use Artillery to keep your GraphQL services in check. Learn more at [Artillery Website](https://www.artillery.io/docs)
